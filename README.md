# Language Translation Assignment

This is a simple language translation app that takes in text in English and Translate into French.
There is a limit to how long the text to translate can be and the amount of words; we trained this model on an average of 300 unique words.

There is room for a ton of improvement as the model loses context the more words you add, we'll add this in the future.

We intent to make it such you can record yourself and get your voice transcribe into text then translated. Time constraints could not allow that but it is something we envision o experience with along with the overall model improvement.
