# Language Translation Assignment

This is a simple language translation app that takes in text in English and Translate into French.
There is a limit to how long the text to translate can be and the amount of words; we trained this model on an average of 300 unique words.

There is room for a ton of improvement as the model loses context the more words you add; we'll add this in the future.

We intend to make it such you can record yourself and get your voice transcribed into text and then translated. Time constraints could not allow that, but we envision experimenting with it along with the overall model improvement.
